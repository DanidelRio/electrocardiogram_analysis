# Electrocardiogram analysis

You will find interactive Jupyter notebooks for analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. These notebooks range from basic to non-linear techniques. There are three folders, one for images used in the notebooks, another for sample ECG recordings and one for the notebooks in a lighter pdf version. The content available in each notebook is:

1. **Basics:** How to identify P wave, QRS complex or T wave? How to measure heart frequency.
3. **MIT-BIH data:** Uses data from the MIT-BIH database available on Physionet.
4. **Phase space reconstruction:** An introduction of Taken's theorem for reconstructing phase space.
5. **Phase space reconstruction with ECG and Poincar√© plots:** Applies the last notebook in the ECG time series.
6. **Animations in phase space:** Provides a clearer perspective in which phase space is reconstructed through animations.
7. **Recurrence plot:** Analysis of the ECG with recurrence plots.
8. **Rest vs. exercise:** Comparison in one individual of two time series, before and after doing exercise. Uses previous techniques.
9. **Batch processing rest vs. exercise:** Comparison of several individuals, before and after doing exercise.
